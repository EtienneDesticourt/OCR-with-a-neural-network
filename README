Optical character recognition with a neural network.

A few notes:
	The layer class is pretty much pointless, I thought I might need it to better visualize it all but I didn't end up using it this way. It could be remove but not really worth the time for this simple project.
	I didn't comment the code in the Drawing folder, it was just a quick and dirty solution to generate the dataset.
